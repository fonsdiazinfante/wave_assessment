# Getting Started with Wave Assessment

Welcome to the Wave Assessment made by Alfonso Diaz Infante

## To get started

Clone this directory into your local computer.\
Open 2 terminals (one for back end & another for  front end).\
For your frontend terminal: 
- CD into the directory
- ### `npm install` 
- ### `npm start`

For Backend terminal:
- CD into the directory
- CD into the backend folder
- ### `nodemon server`

This should run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Questions and answers

1.- How did you test that your implementation was correct?\

By designing the schema on paper first and later coding it, only runing in development mode and console.logging to compare my desired outputs vs. actual

2.- If this application was destined for a production environment, what would you add or change?\

I would do a lot more test driven development with various end to end tests and component test\

3.- What compromises did you have to make as a result of the time constraints of this challenge?\

I didn't write any tests and or edge case validations on the backend.\
I also couldn't finish implementing the report part where same id's are grouped together and added depending on what pay period they are on
